Terrain Media Generator (TMG) v1.2

This software is freeware and without support.
Everything done by Johnny B. of zac-interactive except shadow code based of code from BlitzBasic.com code archieves by Flynn.

No real documentation exist for this piece of software, but most
will be pretty selfexplanatory, but here is a brief overview of what it does:

There are four main windows.

1. Colormap Generator:

This window contains a Gradient control area for making a color palette for use with the color mapper. There is a preset load/save and reset for this. Also you will find here some map controls. Here you can load heightmaps, texturemaps and shadowmaps. Or generate a new shadow map based on the currently created heightmap and settins for the sun. You have the choise of merging texturemap, shadowmap or both and set the level of merging for these. Also there is a button that opens up a heightmap editor with some basic drawing funcions for freehanding a heightmap.

2. Heightmap Generator:

This window is used to generate heightmaps of different sizes with random hills based on a few settings. This heightmap can be a regular or an island shaped map.

3. Transition Generator:

This window is mostly used to generate transition texture tiles and there are a number of builtin transitions to choose from. Selecting Custom as the tile size will make the transition generator use the width of the first texture as the resulting tile size.

4. Textured Colormap Generator:

This window will allow you to load up to 8 textures that can be used to generate a colormap that are textured. The colormap is based on height settins for the textures that is then applied according to the height of the heigtmap.

Included is a test color file for the colormapper to show how colors can be set up.

I hope that someone will find this useful for helping with generating terrain media files.

Don't expect too much as far as updates on this software, but feel free to send me an email if you have questions or suggestions.

Kind regards,

Johnny B.
